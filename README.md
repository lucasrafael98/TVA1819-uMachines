# TVA1819-uMachines
Project for the Three-Dimensional Visualiztion and Animation course (18/19) at Instituto Superior Técnico.

**uMachines** is an OpenGL/C++ (`freeglut/glew`) based application inspired by the MicroMachines racing game.

**uMachines3JS** is based on WebGL/`three.js` and should play well on any browser.

**uMachinesVR** is the mobile VR version of the `three.js` game, and it will only work properly on a mobile device in landscape mode (preferrably a fast one, too.)

Made by: Francisco Campaniço, João Rafael, Rodrigo Oliveira.

Some instructions (these should work in both desktop versions):

* Q/A move the car forward/backward
* O/P turn the car left/right
* 1/2/3/4 changes camera modes (in mode 2, you can use the mouse to move the camera around)
* N toggles the "sun" (directional light)
* C toggles candles (point lights)
* H toggles car headlights (spotlights)
* F toggles fog
* S pauses the game
